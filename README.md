## Welcome

#### Here are 2 Lox Language Implementations, JLOX and CLOX

Reading the book crafting interpreters was a blast. To me those small quotes and lines at the beginning of the chapter are like those chocolates one might put in between pages in a book while reading it for an exam, got many recommendations that I will love to read.

I felt like I learnt a lot in this journey, I have learnt why JS is the way it is and many other language features (Lua, Python, Ruby etc were also mentioned). The art of language benchmarks and reading scientific papers was also somethign I learnt.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone to get into compilers. 

I will propbably make another language solely to apply the knowledge I learnt here, one day (lets see how far away that day is lol).
